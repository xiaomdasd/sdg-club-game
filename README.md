## ⚠️ Important: API Key Security

The current code contains a Gemini API key in `script.js`. For public deployment:

### Option 1: Keep it (for demo/educational use)
- Set usage limits on your API key in Google Cloud Console
- Monitor usage regularly

### Option 2: Remove AI feature (safest)
Replace the API call with static results by modifying `predictMBTI()` function.

### Option 3: Use environment variables (advanced)
For production, move the API key to a backend server.
